# Python Introduction :
#---------------------#

    # Python is a general purpose high level programming language.
        # General Purpose --> Common purpose(That means we can use this programming language anywhere)
        # High level programming language --> we need not to take care low level things( address of varibale ,pointers,Memory utilization , Datatype)
        # such type of programming language are known as programmer friendly programing language.


    # Python was developed by Guido Van Rossam in 1989 while working at National Research Institute at Netherlands.
    # But officially Python was made available to public in 1991. The official Date of Birth for Python is : Feb 20th 1991.
    # Python is recommended as first programming language for beginners.
    # Python is implemented before java.(1996 jdk 1.0).

    # The name Python was selected from the TV Show "The Complete Monty Python's Circus", which was broadcasted in BBC from 1969 to 1974.

    # Guido developed Python language by taking almost all programming features from different languages
            # 1.Functional Programming Features from C 
            # 2.Object Oriented Programming Features from C++
            # 3.Scripting Language Features from Perl and Shell Script 
            # 4. Modular Programming Features from Modula-3

    # Most of syntax in Python Derived from "C" and "ABC" languages.

    # Where we can use Python:
        # 1.Machine learning Algorithms--> scikit learn
        # 2.Web Applications --> Django , Flask , tornado etc
        # 3.Data science and Data Analysis --> Numpy , scipy, Pandas
        # 4.Data visualization --> Matplotlib, Seaborn etc..
        # 5.Iot --> Internet of Things --> AI --> Python
        # 6.Game --> Pygame
        # 7.Desktop Application--> Tkinter, flet
        # 8.For developing database Applications
        # 9.For Network Programming

    # Worst case of using Python:
        # 1.Mobile Application --> Java and Kotlin
        # 2.For implementing compiler --> High level programming and it is slow as compared to java

    # Note:
        # Internally Google and Youtube use Python coding.
        # NASA and Nework Stock Exchange Applications developed by Python.
        # Top Software companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Yahoo, dropbox using Python.

    
    # Features of Python:
    
        # 1) Simple and easy to learn:
            # Python is a simple programming language. When we read Python program,we can feel like reading english statements.
