# Python Arguments :


# Python Arbitrary Arguments –
#               In this, we use the asterisk (*) to denote this method before the parameter in the function. 
#               This is also called as Python *args. 
#               Python *args allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments 
#               i.e. arguments which are non-keyword arguments, variable-length argument list.

# Remember 'args' is just a notation. We can use any other argument name instead of it.

# arbitrary arguments come in handy when we don’t know how many arguments are needed in the program at that moment.
