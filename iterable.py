# Iterables: list, dict, tuple, and set
    # In Python, an iterable object (or simply an iterable) is a collection of elements that you can loop (or iterate) through one element at a time.
    
    # An iterable is ordered if you can retrieve its elements in a predictable order
    # An iterable is mutable if you can change which elements it contains
